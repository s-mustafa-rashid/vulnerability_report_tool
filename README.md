# vulnerability_report_tool
 Enhances the Vulnerability Report from Alert Logic by adding the Top 10 By Count, By OS, By Host, In Scope, Out of Scope, and Cloud Posture sheets to the Vulnerability Report. Also sorts the Past Week, SevHigh, SevMedium, and SevLow sheets by CVSS Score. Rearranges the sheet in a more natural progression from left to right.
